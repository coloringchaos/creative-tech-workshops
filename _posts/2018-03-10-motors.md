**BLDG61 Drop-In**<br>
Boulder, Colorado


<hr>

This drop-in session is dedicated to working with motors! This writeup contains information about three different types of motors - servo, DC, and steppers. There are resources and links throughout this page that provide additional learning resources.

Here is a great introductory video all about motors by Jeff Federsen.

## Servo Motors

Servos are the easiest way to start making motion with a microcontroller.

![servo](images/servo-samples.jpg "Servo motor")

Most hobby servos (including the ones we'll be using) only rotate 180°, sweeping back and forth like windshield wipers on a car. They are really useful because you have a high level of control over their position, you can simply write code to move the motor to a specific degree. Originally these kinds of motors were used in remote-controlled cars and airplanes, but they now crop up in all sorts of other applications as well.

Some servo motors do work with continuous rotation, be sure to check

![servo](images/servo3.jpg "Servo connections")

#### Connections

The servo motor has three leads. The color of the leads varies between servo motors, but the red lead is always 5V and GND will either be black or brown. The other lead is the control lead and this is usually orange or yellow. This control lead should be connected to a digital PWM pin on your microcontroller, any pin marked with `~`. Servo motors work using a principle called PWM, and we need to be sure that they are properly wired to one of these pins.

<span class="highlight">***Warning!! Not all servos come with the same wiring colors. If you’re in doubt about your color scheme, check the documentation – don’t plug it in backwards!***</span>

We will be using an analog input to control the servo motor. Connect your input to Analog pin 0 - more about analog inputs are available in [this previous post](/creative-tech-workshops/hello-arduino). Then connect an RC servomotor to digital pin 3. The yellow wire of the servo goes to the pin, and the red and black wires go to +5V and ground, respectively.

#### Code

Arduino has a built in Servo library which makes the code really easy to work with. Be sure to include the library when you're working with servos.

Remember that analog inputs are interpreted by Arduino as a range of values between 0-1023. The servo motor only takes values between 0-179 (which correspond to the angle of rotation), so in order to translate the sensor input to the motor output, we need to use the `map()` function.

```

#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

int sensorPin = 0;  // analog pin used to connect the potentiometer
int sensorVal;    // variable to read the value from the analog pin

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
  sensorVal = analogRead(sensorPin);         // reads the value of the potentiometer (value between 0 and 1023)
  sensorVal = map(val, 0, 1023, 0, 180);     // scale it to use it with the servo (value between 0 and 180)
  myservo.write(sensorVal);                  // sets the servo position according to the scaled value
  delay(15);                                 // waits for the servo to get there
}

```

## DC Motors

DC motors are continuous actuators that take electrical power in the form of direct current and convert it into mechanical rotation. To operate a DC motor, you simply apply voltage across the leads - the direction fo the voltage controls the direction that the motor will move. Because DC motors produce a continuous angular rotation, they are most often used to rotate pumps, fans, compressors, wheels, etc. These motors are easy to work with, and they typically have high speed, low-torque characteristics. You can trade speed for torque by adding a gearbox, which also allows for more precise control of the motor.

![dc](images/dc-motor.png "DC Motor")

#### Connections

DC motors have just two leads, and they are usually color coded black and red. The direction that you connect the motor in your circuit will determine the direction that the motor spins. Typically you will connect red toward power and black toward ground, but if you were to reverse these, it would simply change the direction that your motor turns.

If you want to reverse the direction of your motor programmatically, you will need an additional piece of hardware called an **H-Bridge** that is capable of switching the polarity. ITP has a really useful tutorial about [DC Motor Control with an H-Bridge](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/dc-motor-control-using-an-h-bridge/).

The best method for controlling the speed of a DC motor is to use a **transistor**. This tutorial will focus on that. We will use an Arduino analog output (PWM) to control the speed of the motor by sending a number between 0 and 255 from the Serial Monitor.

***Necessary parts:***
+ Small 6V DC Motor
+ PN2222 Transistor
+ 1N4001 diode
+ 270 Ω Resistor
+ Arduino Uno or Sparkfun Redboard, Breadboard & USB


![dc](images/dc-transistor.jpg "DC Motor with Transistor")

#### Code

```
int motorPin = 3;

void setup() {
  pinMode(motorPin, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (! Serial);
  Serial.println("Speed 0 to 255");
}


void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()){
    int speed = Serial.parseInt();
    if (speed >= 0 && speed <= 255){
      analogWrite(motorPin, speed);
    }
  }
}
```

Upload your code and test it out! To control the speed of the motor, you should open your serial monitor and type in a value between 0 and 255. To open the Serial Monitor, go to ***Tools -> Serial Monitor***.

## Stepper Motors

![steppers](images/steppers.jpg "Steppers")

Stepper motors are very similar to DC motors except that they move in discreet steps. They have multiple coils that are organized in groups called "phases". By energizing each phase in sequence, the motor will rotate, one step at a time. Stepper motors are very useful because we can count each time they step, thus allowing for a very precise level of control. Stepper motors are great for anything that requires precise position and speed control, and low-torque applications. They are commonly found in 3D printers, CNC, camera platforms, and X,Y plotters

#### Driving a Stepper

Driving a stepper motor is a bit more complicated than driving a regular brushed DC motor. Stepper motors require a stepper controller to energize the phases in a timely sequence to make the motor turn. You can do this using several **transistors**, which is the simples type of motor driver. Another common option is to use an **H-Bridge**, which is typically the way I work with steppers.

My favorite product for driving stepper motors, and arguably the easiest way to quickly get up and running with steppers, is the [EasyDriver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12779). Sparkfun also has a great [hookup guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/easy-driver-hook-up-guide) for using this part.
