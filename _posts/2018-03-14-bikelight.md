title: "Bike Light"
description: "This session is dedicated to learning about motors! We will explore DC, servo, and stepper motors to make simple cardboard robots and interactive kinetic sculptures. Arielle will demonstrate a selection of motor options that can be utilized in electronics projects, and there will be the opportunity for students to integrate these into their projects. We will also discuss different microcontroller options and circuitry for powering motors.

**Workshop by Arielle Hein** <br>
Thursday, March 15th 2018

**BLDG61 Electronics Workshop**<br>
Boulder, Colorado


<hr>

In this special workshop for Bike Week, participants will learn to program, assemble, and solder their own custom made LED bike light. This hands-on session will be an opportunity for participants to learn how to build an interactive circuit from scratch using an ATtiny85 and Neopixel LEDs. The workshop focuses on building skills in hardware, software, and fabrication.

## Programming the ATtiny85



<br>

## Assembly Instructions

#### **Step 1: Add DIP Socket**

Be sure to position the socket so that the notch at the top is closest to the end of the prototyping board.

#### **Step 2: Add 2 Resistors**

You will be adding 2 resistors, one is 470Ω for the neopixel strip and connects to pin 2 on the ATtiny. The other is 10KΩ and connects between pin 1 (reset) and pin 8 (5V) on the ATtiny.

#### **Step 2: Add Capacitor**

Next, add a 100uF capacitor between pin 4 (GND) and pin 8 (5V) of the ATtiny. Bending the leads 90 degrees allows the capacitor to lay flat against the board.
