title: "Creative Computation"
description: "This class introduces fundamentals of programming concepts while creating interactive visual compositions that integrate with programmable hardware. The foundation of this class is p5.js, a JavaScript library by the Processing Foundation, which makes creative coding accessible for artists, designers, educators and beginners. In this workshop, we will get up and running with the p5 framework, and develop an interactive drawing program in the browser. We will then learn to integrate physical controllers and sensors using Arduino to manipulate our drawing application. You will walk away from this class having built an interactive interfaces that integrates both hardware and software. "

**Workshop by Arielle Hein** <br>
Thursday, February 15th 2018

**BLDG61 Workshop**<br>
Boulder, Colorado

## Context
P5.js is a client-side JavaScript library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing - to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners.

P5 is a useful framework to use in conjunction with hardware (like Arduino) because it allows us to create interactive systems with rich visual (screen-based) elements. In this workshop we will use *serial communication* between a computer and a microcontroller to send data from the physical world to the computer to visualize.

## Serial Communication
Serial communication is a method of sending and receiving data between two computers or devices. In this example we will communicate between an Arduino microcontroller and a p5 sketch that is running on our computer.

First, set up your circuit. We will start with using a simple potentiometer to send a single value to P5. Here is the circuit.

![potentiometer](images/potentiometer.png "Potentiometer wiring")

Next, we need to program the Arduino.

<pre>
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // initialize serial communication
}

void loop() {
  // read the value from the sensor:
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);

  //print the value to the serial monitor so that we can see it
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(1);
}
</pre>

<br>

Finally, we can move on to P5. Start with this [P5 Serial Template](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/coloringchaos/sketches/BkO7oXmvf) <br>ðŸ‘‰ Choose ***file -> duplicate*** and save the sketch to your own account

The complete finished code that we worked with for [sending two sensor values to P5 is here](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/coloringchaos/sketches/HJi61UXDG)
